# combination

This python code solves common combination or "code break" problems. For example, given:
5816: One number correct in the right position, one number correct in the wrong position
3826: Two numbers correct but in the wrong position
1983: Two numbers correct but in the wrong position
1427: One number correct but in the wrong position

... this code will give the only possible answers (with and without repeating digits). In this example, the unique solution is 5438. 

Formatting for the input is given in the code header.
